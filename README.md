# Dream Read
  In a perfect world, we would read all the books we want, right when we want to read them. Unfortunately, we have to do other things, like work jobs and meet our basic human needs, so our dream reading lists grow. 
  
  Dream Read is a space to hold onto the hope that you’ll eventually read that book your therapist recommended two years ago AND keep up with your book club’s agenda. 
  
  Using Dream read, you can organize that TBR list so that you feel like you’re doing something with it! Create your own book entries from scratch or browse the Google Books database to find the next book you won't want to put down. Tag books by low, medium, or high priority so that you can make the most of your precious reading time. Add commentary on each book so that you can remember WHY you wanted to read it in the first place.

  Go ahead, use Dream Read and make your reading goals a reality.
